# 📚 Book Scraping and Database Storage

Welcome to the **Book Scraping and Database Storage** project! This project scrapes book data from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/), stores the information in a **SQLite** database, and provides a simple, clean interface to inspect the data. This project is a great starting point for learning web scraping with Python, and I have completed it as a beginner.
